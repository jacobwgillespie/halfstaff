      "Since America&apos;s earliest days, proud patriots have forged a safer, more secure Nation, and though battlefields have changed and technology has evolved, the selflessness of our service members has remained steadfast.&#xA0; They have stepped forward when our country was locked in revolution and civil war; fought threats of fascism and terrorism; and led the way in securing peace and stability around the globe.&#xA0; They have sacrificed more&#xA0;than most of us could ever imagine -- not for glory or gratitude, but for causes greater than themselves.&#xA0; In the children who replicate their courage and strength, in the spouses and partners who forever seek to mend their broken hearts, and in the parents who mourn the absence of the sons and daughters they raised, we are reminded of our enduring commitment to do right by our fallen warriors and their families.",
      "Those who gave their last full measure of devotion for the values that bind us as one people deserve our utmost respect and gratitude.&#xA0; In recognizing those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we pledge to never stop working to fulfill our obligations to all members of our Armed Forces so they know we stand beside them every step of the way -- not just when we need them, but also when they need us.",

      "In moments of danger and desperation, the first people we turn to are law enforcement officers.&#xA0; These often unsung heroes risk their lives and sacrifice precious time with loved ones so their fellow Americans can live in peace and security.&#xA0; But more than that, they are leaders in their communities, serving as mentors, coaches, friends, and neighbors -- working tirelessly each day to ensure that the people they serve have the opportunities that should be afforded to all Americans.&#xA0; In honor of all they do, we must give these dedicated professionals the support and appreciation they deserve.",
      "My Administration continues to work to ensure police departments and other law enforcement agencies throughout our country have the resources required to hire, train, and retain officers, provide officers with modern and necessary equipment, and utilize technology to enhance their communication networks.&#xA0; And our Federal law enforcement officers regularly partner with their State and local counterparts to address some of our Nation&#x2019;s most difficult problems.&#xA0; We know that strong community bonds are essential for law enforcement to do their jobs effectively.&#xA0; I established a Task Force on 21st Century Policing, bringing together law enforcement, academia, youth, civil rights, and community leaders to provide concrete recommendations to enhance public safety while building community trust.&#xA0; Law enforcement officials care deeply about their communities, and together with our partners in law enforcement, we must work to build up our neighborhoods, prevent crime before it happens, and put opportunity within reach for all our people.&#xA0;",
      "Because each fallen peace officer is one too many,&#xA0;I proudly signed the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act last year -- bipartisan legislation that establishes a national &quot;Blue Alert&quot; communications network to disseminate information about threats to officers.&#xA0; The&#xA0;legislation seeks to ensure that appropriate steps can be taken as quickly as possible to provide for an officer&apos;s safety.&#xA0; I also announced new, commonsense gun safety reforms to help keep guns out of the wrong hands and emphasized that the already dangerous job of an officer is far more dangerous than it should be because it remains too easy for criminals and people who are a danger to others or themselves to have access to guns.",
      "&#xA0;It takes a special kind of courage to be a peace officer.&#xA0; Whether deputies or detectives, tribal police or forest service officers, beat cops or Federal agents, we hold up those who wear the badge as heroes.&#xA0; Though they too often spend their days witnessing America at its worst, in their extraordinary examples, we see America at its best.&#xA0; On this day and throughout this week, let us celebrate those who nobly serve each day -- and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice -- to move our world toward a more just and safe tomorrow.&#xA0; May we carry forward their brave and selfless spirit as we keep working together to shape a future worthy of their commitment.&#xA0;",

And our Federal law enforcement officers regularly partner with their State and local counterparts to address some of our Nation&#x2019;s most difficult problems.&#xA0; We know that strong community bonds are essential for law enforcement to do their jobs effectively.&#xA0; I established a Task Force on 21st Century Policing, bringing together law enforcement, academia, youth, civil rights, and community leaders to provide concrete recommendations to enhance public safety while building community trust.&#xA0; Law enforcement officials care deeply about their communities, and together with our partners in law enforcement, we must work to build up our neighborhoods, prevent crime before it happens, and put opportunity within reach for all our people.</p><p>Because each fallen peace officer is one too many,&#xA0;I proudly signed the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act last year -- bipartisan legislation that establishes a national &quot;Blue Alert&quot; communications network to disseminate information about threats to officers.&#xA0; The&#xA0;legislation seeks to ensure that appropriate steps can be taken as quickly as possible to provide for an officer&apos;s safety.&#xA0; I also announced new, commonsense gun safety reforms to help keep guns out of the wrong hands and emphasized that the already dangerous job of an officer is far more dangerous than it should be because it remains too easy for criminals and people who are a danger to others or themselves to have access to guns.</p><p>&#xA0;It takes a special kind of courage to be a peace officer.&#xA0; Whether deputies or detectives, tribal police or forest service officers, beat cops or Federal agents, we hold up those who wear the badge as heroes.&#xA0; Though they too often spend their days witnessing America at its worst, in their extraordinary examples, we see America at its best.&#xA0; On this day and throughout this week, let us celebrate those who nobly serve each day -- and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice -- to move our world toward a more just and safe tomorrow.&#xA0; May we carry forward their brave and selfless spirit as we keep working together to shape a future worthy of their commitment.</p><p>By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136-137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as &quot;Peace Officers Memorial Day&quot; and the week in which it falls as &quot;Police Week.&quot;</p><p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the&#xA0;United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2016, as&#xA0;Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 15 through May 21, 2016, as Police Week.&#xA0; I call upon all Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities.&#xA0; I also call on the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day.&#xA0; I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.</p><p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.</p><p class=\"center\"></p><p class=\"center\">BARACK OBAMA</p>",
